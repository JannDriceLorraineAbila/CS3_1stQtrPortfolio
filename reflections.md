# Reflections
## 1. List and describe at least 5 topics that we discussed in class that you know very well.  
1. **Variables and Data Types**  
   I understand how variables work and how data types affect the kind of values stored. I can explain the difference between strings, numbers, and booleans, and I know when to use each one. This topic is clear to me because of the many coding exercises we did in class.  

2. **Arithmetic Operators**  
   Arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical operations. I already had some background knowledge from math and other subjects, so it was easier to connect with programming. I can solve problems using `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, and `%` without difficulty.  

3. **Conditional Statements (if-else)**  
   I know how to use conditional statements to make decisions in a program. They are important because they allow the program to run differently depending on the situation. I feel confident with this because we had multiple practice activities.  

4. **Loops (for and while)**  
   Loops repeat a set of instructions until a condition is met. I can write both `for` and `while` loops to solve problems like counting or repeating processes. I understand this well because of our exercises and examples in class.  

5. **Basic Git and GitHub Commands**  
   I understand how to push, pull, and commit files to GitHub. I can also create repositories and edit files in VSCode. This is useful for keeping track of my work and submitting projects.

## 2. List at least 5 topics that you know and can describe but need further practice/discussion and why.  
1. **Functions** – I can explain what functions are, but I sometimes get confused about parameters and return values.  
2. **Nested Loops** – I understand the concept but still get confused when applying it to more complex problems.  
3. **Arrays** – I know arrays are lists of values, but I need more practice in looping through them and using built-in methods.  
4. **Objects** – I can describe what an object is, but I still mix up syntax when trying to use properties and methods.  
5. **Error Handling (try-catch)** – I know what it does, but I haven’t practiced enough to feel confident using it.

## 3. Describe your plan of action in order to help yourself in understanding further the topics listed on the second item.  
1. For **functions**, I will review more examples and write simple programs that use parameters and return values.  
2. For **nested loops**, I will practice solving exercises that involve patterns, multiplication tables, and arrays.  
3. For **arrays**, I will focus on practicing methods like `push()`, `pop()`, `length`, and looping.  
4. For **objects**, I will write more examples and compare them with arrays to understand differences better.  
5. For **error handling**, I will review tutorials and practice coding situations where errors might occur.

## 4. In the activities that were done in class, list at least two that you think were effective and at least two that you think were not effective in helping you understand topics in our course and why.  

**Effective:**  
1. **Hands-on Coding Exercises** – These activities really helped because I could apply what we learned immediately. Doing examples by myself made the lessons clearer.  
2. **Pair Programming/Group Work** – Working with classmates helped me understand different solutions and approaches.  

**Not Effective:**  
1. **Long Lectures Without Practice** – Sometimes when the discussion was too long, I lost focus and didn’t retain the lesson as well.  
2. **Copying Code from the Board** – This was less effective because I wasn’t really understanding the logic, just copying it down. I learned better when I typed and tested code myself.
